# Vehicle Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project, "Vehicle Price Prediction using Regression Analysis," aims to predict vehicle prices based on various features using multiple regression techniques. The dataset used is the "Australian Vehicle Prices" dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as Year, Transmission, Fuel Consumption, Kilometers driven, Engine size, and more. The objective is to develop and analyze regression models to accurately predict the prices of vehicles.

## Methodology

1. **Data Pre-Processing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution and correlation of features.
3. **Model Building**:
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Building and evaluating the full model with all features.
   - **All Possible Subsets Regression**: Identifying the best subset of features for prediction.

## Results

- **Multiple Linear Regression Model**: Achieved an R-squared of 0.717 and an Adjusted R-squared of 0.714.
- **Subset Regression Analysis**: Provided insights into the most significant predictors of vehicle price.

## Conclusion

The regression models provide a robust framework for predicting vehicle prices based on various features. The analysis highlights the importance of features such as Year, Transmission, Fuel Consumption, Kilometers, and Engine size in determining vehicle prices.
